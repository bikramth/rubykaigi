        When he isn’t ruining people’s lives by writing software like phuby,
        enterprise, and neversaydie, Aaron can be found writing slightly more
        useful software like nokogiri. To keep up his Gameboy Lifestyle, Aaron
        spends his weekdays writing high quality software for ATTi. Be sure to
        catch him on Karaoke night, where you can watch him sing his favorite
        smooth rock hits of the 70’s and early 80’s.
